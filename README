Overview:
This is a program that can encrypt and decrypt input files using input keys. Key needs to be stored in a file, 8 numbers one per line. Please see the example key file. 
Block Ciphers and their operational modes supported:
TEA- Tiny Encryption Algorithm (CBC, OFB, CTR)
DES- Data Encryption Standard (CBC, OFB)

1. To Build the program please run:
chmod u+x build.sh
./build.sh

2. To Get Performance Statistics:
chmod u+x performance.sh
./performance.sh

3. To encrypt or decrypt a single file after building the program:
./program -e tea CBT key input.txt ciphertext
./program -d tea CBT key ciphertext plaintext
./program -e tea CTR key input.txt ciphertext
./program -d tea CTR key ciphertext plaintext
./program -e tea OFB key input.txt ciphertext
./program -d tea OFB key ciphertext plaintext
./program -e des CBT key input.txt ciphertext
./program -d des CBT key ciphertext plaintext
./program -e des OFB key input.txt ciphertext
./program -d des OFB key ciphertext plaintext
#executable [operation mode -e(encription) or -d(decription] [Block Cipher: tea or des] [Block Cipher Mode: CBT, or OFB] [Key file name(8 integer numbers one on each line)] [input file name] [output file name]
